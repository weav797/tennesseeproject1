History of Tennesee

This was a final project I completed during my time in community college. With this project, I was instrcuted to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS (mainly CSS) by designing this simple website using various font-sizes, colors, etc. As part of the exam, I was also instructed to demonstrate my understanding of audio controls and YouTube video integration.

Briefly, this is a website that discusses major events that happened in the state of Tennessee. Such as The Battle of Shiloh, The MLK assasination, etc.
