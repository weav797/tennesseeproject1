	    <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY of the STATE</h2>
	    <h4>Early History</h4>

	    <p>Indian burial mounds throughout the state of Tennessee provide evidence of the earliest 
	       settlers here.  Paleo-Indians are believed to have hunted and camped in what is now 
	       Tennessee as early as 12,000 years ago. Along with projectile points common for this period, 
	       archaeologists in Williamson County have uncovered a 12,000-year-old mastodon skeleton with 
	       cut marks typical of prehistoric hunters.  Indian villages are found along the banks of most 
	       of the major rivers in Tennessee.  These Indian tribes became part of the Cherokee nation.
	    </p>
	    <p>The earliest written histories of Tennessee were penned in the mid-16th century, 
	       about the Hernando de Soto Expeditions.  Later, French explorers and traders were 
	       in evidence, establishing a presence at Fort Assumption during the Indian Wars.  
	       A century later, Tennessee became the western counties of North Carolina, but after 
	       the Revolutionary War, North Carolina no longer wanted to continue trying to govern 
	       these distant counties.  On June 1, 1796, Congress approved the admission of Tennessee 
	        the sixteenth state of the Union.

	         alt="Battle of Shiloh">
	    <p>During the Civil War, Tennessee became the last state to officially withdraw from the Union, 
	       by the slimmest of votes.  As a border state, Tennessee saw numerous battles, mostly won by 
	       the Union troops, and Nashville was the first Confederate state capital to fall to the Union.  
	       After the war, Tennessee was also the first state readmitted to the Union on July 24, 1866.  
	       It also was the only Confederate state that was not assigned a military governor during 
	       Reconstruction.

			    Scopes Trial
			</dt>
				<dd>In 1925, John T. Scopes, a high school biology teacher, stood trial in Dayton, Tennessee  
				    for violating a law that forbade the teaching of evolution in the public schools. 
				    The Courthouse was turned into a circus of national and even international media coverage, 
				     to witness the high-powered legal counsels, William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, and 
				    Clarence Darrow for the defense, argue their case. The story was told in the movie
				    <span class="movie">Inherit the Wind</span>.
