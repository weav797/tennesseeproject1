    	<h2>OFFICIAL SONGS of TENNESSEE</h2>
    	<p>Do you know the Tennessee State Official Song?  
    	   <br>Do you think it is "Rocky Top", or "The Tennessee Waltz"?
    	   <br>  
    	   Or none of these?  Actually, if you answered "YES" to any of these questions, you would be right!  
    	   Tennessee may have more "official songs" than any other state - 10 are officially listed on the state website 
    	   <a href="https://www.tn.gov/main/article/state-songs" target="_blank">
    	   (https://www.tn.gov/main/article/state-songs)</a>. And yes, both of these are listed in the list. 
    	</p>
    	<p>The oldest listed song is actually "My Homeland, Tennessee", adopted in 1925, with Lyrics by Nell Grayson Taylor,
    	    music by Roy Lamont Smith. Likely, most Tennesseans have never even heard it! 
    	    "Tennessee Waltz" (Written by Redd Stewart, composed by Pee Wee King) is a late-comer, and wasn't adopted until 1965. 
    	    "Rocky Top" didn't make the list until 1982. This bluegrass standard was written in only ten minutes in 1967 
    	    by the husband/wife songwriting team of Felice and Boudleaux Bryant. It didn't become one of the state official 
    	    songs until after adopted by the University of Tennessee as their "favorite song". 
    	    (Rocky Top is not the official fight song of the University of Tennessee, although it has become synonymous 
    	    with UT since the band first played it in 1972.)

    	<p>The two most recent entries in the official list are "Smokey Mountain Rain" and "Tennessee".  
    	   "Smokey Mountain Rain", written by Kye Fleming and Dennis Morgan, was a major, signature hit for singer 
    	   Ronnie Milsap in the early 1980s, and was adopted by the state in 2010.  
    	   "Tennessee", by John R. Bean, was written specifically as a state song, but again it is not a song that most 
    	   Tennesseans would recognize. There is even a rap song in the official list! The "Tennessee Bicentennial Rap" 
    	   was written by poet Joan Hill Hanks of Signal Mountain, Tennessee. In 1995 she wrote the poem that became 
    	   the "Bicentennial Rap" as a fun and interesting way to teach students and citizens about the history of Tennessee. 
    	   In 1996, it became Tennessee's official "Bicentennial Rap".
